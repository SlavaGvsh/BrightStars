        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The BrightStars quality rating and improvement system was developed by a team of local early childhood and school-age care professionals and reviewed by national experts. Parents with children enrolled in child care and early learning programs were consulted to better understand the information that would be most helpful for families. BrightStars is managed by the Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children (RIAEYC).ETXRhode Island KIDS COUNT coordinated the design phase and continues to provide support for evaluation and marketing. </p>
